Create an interface named Turner, with a single method named turn().
Create a class named Leaf that implements turn() to display Changing colors.
Create a class named Page that implements turn() to display Going to the
next page. Create a class named Pancake that implements turn() to display
Flipping.
Write an application named DemoTurners that creates one object of each of
these class types and demonstrates the turn() method for each class. Save
the files as Turner.java, Leaf.java, Page.java, Pancake.java, and
DemoTurners.java.
Think of two more objects that use turn(), create classes for them, and then
add objects to the DemoTurners application, renaming it DemoTurners2.
java. Save the files, using the names of new objects that use turn().*/
